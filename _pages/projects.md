**Description:** For a hackathon I built a front-end in React. Prior to this I had never worked with React. I used this opportunity to stretch myself technologically and force myself to learn React in only 3 days! It was amazing to see how quickly you can create a web application with today's technologies! 

**Technologies:** JavaScript, React, NodeJS, Python

**Code:** [Github]()
