**Description:** To really grok (learn thoroughly) how neural networks
*actually* learn I decided to build one for myself without any
external libraries. I also streamed this on Twitch which added another
layer of fun on top of there because there were always people watching
me code and helping me out when I got stuck. The code can be found on
Github, I warn you, it's not pretty, but it works (on my machine)!

**Technologies:** Python, numpy

**Videos:** [Part 1 (Youtube)]() [Part 2 (Youtube)]()

**Code:** [Github]()
