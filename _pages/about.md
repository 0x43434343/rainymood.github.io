# Jan Meppe

So here's a picture of me so you know what I look like.

That's me!

I see my self as a (in descending order of importance):
- problem solver
- data scientist
- machine learning engineer

I am obsessed with problem solving, technology, product, and design.

I hold an MPhil in (Advanced) Econometrics from the [Tinbergen Institute](https://www.tinbergen.nl/home), another MSc in Econometrics from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), and a BSc in Econometrics also from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en)
