## Draft posts

To preview draft posts, put *undated* posts in the `_drafts/` folder and then
build/serve jekyll with the `--draft` flag. This is included in the rakefile. 

## Workaround

Because of an annoying unicode error we have a slight workaround and build the
site using `rake build` instead of `bundle exec jekyll serve/build`
