# About me

# Education 

## 2006 - 2012 Highschool 

I attended the Gymnasium in a little town in The Netherlands
called Hoorn, somewhere in the top left corner near the water. 

I learned
that loved drawing and creating stuff, but also learned that I loved the exact
sciences, mathematics in particular. 

I graduated almost cum laude with a 7.9 average. At that period in my life I
always thought I was going to become a doctor for some reason. However, because I didn't graduate cum laude I had to attend
the lottery just like everyone else who didn't graduate cum laude. People who
graduate with an 8.0 average get admitted immediately. My chance of
getting admitted was amongst the highest because of my average grad, but there
still remained this slight chance that I wouldn't get in. 

Guess what -  I didn't get in. 

Bollocks. Time to find something else. It turned out that on the central finals I
scored really well on mathematics final and I figured I might be on to something. 

## BSc Econometrics 

From 2012-2015 I went to the University of Amsterdam and worked on my BSc in
econometrics. In The Netherlands the BSc econometrics is generally regarded as a tough
study because of the ridiculous amount of mathematics that is thrown at you from
day one. Indeed, it was very difficult sometimes, but having a motivated group of
friends who are working towards the same goal helps tremendously and a lot of
credit should go towards them as well. I graduated with a 7.9492 average with no
resits. Yes you read that right. Again, I did not graduate cum laude but this
time on 1/1000 point instead of 1/10 point. 

## MSc Econometrics

In the academic year of 2015-2016 I continued my studies with an MSc in
financial econometrics at the University of Amsterdam. I didn't think it was
possible but the workload was even higher than in the BSc. Again, I tried really
hard to graduate cum laude but the rules for graduating cum laude for your MSc
are even stricter. I now have the 8.2 average, but I already received too much
grades below a certain threshold, which can not be compensated with other high
grades. So far my life consists mainly of the disappointment of not graduating
cum laude thrice (just kidding). 

The courses that I took during my MSc financial econometrics were as follows:
Advanced econometrics 1, Non-linear Economic Dynamics, General Equilibrium
Theory, Game Theory, Derivatives, Advanced Econometrics 2, Financial
Econometrics, Micro-econometrics, Stochastic Calculus.



## MPhil at Tinbergen and PhD




# scrap 

I really enjoyed the micro-econometrics course as we disussed 2 papers each week
where econometric methods were used to tackle a wide variety of problems. We
discussed schooling preferences of parents, video game console sales, the effect
of pot use on mental health, peanut butter sales (yes, really), and much more.

In my BSc thesis I applied a natural language processing algorithm to earnings
calls to analyse whether there are certain topics in these earnings calls that
can explain additional volatility of the stock price in the days following the
earnings call.
