# How to memorise the first ~~26~~ ~~32~~ 42 digits of Pi

tl;dr I memorised the first 42 digits of Pi. When I started writing this blog
post (3-10-2016) I memorised the first 26 digits. I've put off finishing this
blog post for so long already that I'm currently at the 42nd digit (as of
22-11-2016). It turns out that memorising a long string of digits takes some
work but is not that difficult at all. This blog post details how its done and
how I did it. 

# Introduction

From the top of my head (you guys will have to take my word for this) the ~~26~~
~~32~~ 42 decimals of Pi are:

~~3.14159265358979323846264338~~

~~3.14159265358979323846264338327950~~

3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939

Neat. 

Memorising a string of numbers might seem like some completely useless magic
trick and waste of mental capacity. I did not write blog post to convince you of
the usefulness, merely to describe how I did it.

In this blog post I will detail (and perhaps even teach you) how to do this! The
two main ingredients are:

1. Breaking Pi down into bite-sized pieces. 
2. A system to map digits to letters. 

The key point I want to emphasise is that your brain is pretty awesome and can do a
lot more than you think you are capable of. **I firmly believe that (with some
practice) you can easily remember the first 10 digits after reading this post.**

The question I most get asked is: "... why?"

# What started it all

The story actually goes back to 2012: My sister introduced me to the book
*Moonwalking With Einstein* by Joshua Fouer and I finished it relatively quickly
because I liked it a lot. As if God himself had planned it, two girls came into our
drawing class the next day (the day after I finished the book) and wanted to do some
psychological tests. 

The test was as follows: here is a list of 50 words and you have 5 minutes to
memorise as much words as possible. 

I thought, "Wow, this is the perfect
opportunity to test out what I just learned [in Moonwalking With Einstein]!" I was
surprised by my own performance. I managed to memorise 49/50 words while the
class average was around 20.

Fast forward to 2016 with me being ill and lying in bed. I couldn't fall asleep,
so I felt like exercising my brain. I remembered quite some time had passed
since I last built a serious memory palace.

Then, as I was laying there I wondered ... how many digits of Pi could I
memorise? That particular night I managed to memorise the first 12 digits, and
well ... I just kept going!

# Step 1: Break it down

In general, a good way to tackle any problem is to break it down into multiple
smaller subproblems. Memorising the first 100 decimals of Pi is pretty hard, but
memorising the first 2 should be fine, then we add 2 more, and 2 more, and so
on.

I looked at each pair of decimals 

    3.1415926535... 

Which gives (looking only at the decimals)

    14, 15, 92, 65, 35, ... 

Now we will map these numbers to words! 

# Step 2: From numbers to words

After breaking Pi down into pairs of numbers, we will need to translate these
pairs to words. The first step in creating these words is to map the individual
numbers to letters through a so called mnemoic system.

## Mnemoic system (translating numbers to letters)

This mnemoic system is a mapping of the numbers 0-9 to
a set of letters (consonants in this case). 

I particularly like this one because it actually has some mappings that make
sense. Allow me to first introduce the system, and then show you why this system makes sense. The system is as follows: 

1 - t 

2 - n

3 - m

4 - 4 

5 - l 

6 - j 

7 - f 

8 - k,g 

9 - p,b 

0 - s,z 

I admit. Memorising this system takes work and practice, but I do think it's
worth it. To ease this task a little bit these mappings do have some logic
behind them. Here's why:

1 - t (1 leg)

2 - n (2 legs) 

3 - m (3 legs)

4 - 4 (fouR)

5 - l (roman 50)

6 - j (looks like a reversed j)

7 - f (fancy f looks like a 7)

8 - k,g (just remember this one)

9 - p,b (upside-down b looks like a 9 )

0 - s,z (zero)

I just showed you a system which can map *numbers* to *consonants*. We can now
insert *any* vowel in between them to make our words! 

## Putting two and two together 

We are now ready to put it all together. Recall the first 10 decimals
of Pi in pairs

    14, 15, 92, 65, 35, ... 
    
The number 14 contains the numbers 1 and 4. Using the system above this
translates to "tr". I put an "o" in there and you get the word "tor" (beatle in Dutch). 

    14 => "tr" => "tor" (beatle)
    
The next number is 15. Using the system above this translates to "tl". I cheated
the system here a bit and made the word "tortellini" which is actually a violation of the
rules, but rules are meant to be broken. 

    15 => "tl" => "tortelinni"

Try now to really visualise in your mind a little pasta laying around with a
cute beatle on top.
    
The third pair is the number 92. 92 translates to "pn". This one is easy, isn't
it? Just imagine a pan. So pan means 92 ...

    92 => "pn" => "pan"

What we are doing right now is creating the building blocks for our *memory palace*. 

It might seem foolish to put so much effort in creating a memory palace for only the 
first 6 decimals. One can just as easily memorise 141592, right? 

Yes. That is true. However, trying to brute force this gets
exponentially harder with an increasing amount of digits. 

So, what do we have so far?

We have a *beatle* (tor => tr => 14) standing on top of a little *tortellini*
(tl => 15) inside a *pan* (pn = 92). To find the digits of Pi we now "invert"
our story. Beatle, pasta, pan: 3.141592. Bam! That's already 6 decimals down!
Two more pairs and we're at 10 decimals, exciting!

The next number is 65. Translating 65 gives "jl". You could translate this to
"jelly" but I used the name "Jill" and I imagine her face (Hi Jill!). Let's go
with jelly.

    65 => "jl" => "jelly"
    
65, jelly. 65, jelly. 65, jelly. Okay we had a beatle on a little pasta 
inside a pan. Instead of the pan being on the stove, imagine the pan
standing on top of a jar of jelly, which means 65. Beatle (14) on a pasta (15)
inside a pan (92) on top of a jar of jelly (65).

The last pair (9th and 10th decimals) is 35. This translates to "ml". I leave
this one up to you. This is left as an exercise for the reader.

## In conclusion

Summarizing, in this blog post I first detailed a system to map numbers to
letters. Then we split the first 10 digits of Pi into pairs, and using the
system we made a short story. The story goes as follows: imagine a little beatle
(14) on a pasta (15) inside of a pan (92) on top of a jar of jelly (65)
surrounded by a bunch of white flour (ml; meel; flour in dutch; 35).

This gives us the first 10 decimals of Pi: 3.1415926535.

That's really all there is to it! The only difference between the first 10
decimals and the first 100 decimals is just the length of the story.

I hope you enjoyed this post!
