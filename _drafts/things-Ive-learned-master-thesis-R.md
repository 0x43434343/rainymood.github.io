Points:
    * Split up your R files into logical bite-sized pieces
    * Regular R sucks when doing memory intensive stuff 
    * Avoid for loops at all costs, but sometimes they are a neccessary because
      of the trade-off of for loop empty code and time saved
    * Paper first, then programming
    * R has Vim bindings
    * The REPL Rstudio environment is really neat
    * Know your data types (i.e. matrix converts all to one data type!!!)
    * Document your magic moments 
        - sometimes you hack something toegether and it just works, make sure
          you document it so that 2 months later you still understand what why
          and how you did it 
    * and much more
