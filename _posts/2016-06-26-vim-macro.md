# Quick application of a Vim macro in RStudio

Two things. First, while I am doing _anything_ I am constantly thinking to
myself: "Is there any way I can do this quicker, faster, better, or can this be
automated?" Second, RStudio has Vim bindings, how cool is that.

I just used a Vim macro for the first time (in a useful way) and I
wanted to share this with you guys!

But what is a macro anyway? 

A macro has multiple meanings but in this context 
I will stick to this one: a macro is a series of commands recorded to a register. 

How do you record a macro? 

To record a macro in Vim you do the following: `q<letter><commands>q`.  So you
press `q`, then a letter in which you want to store the macro (the register),
then you do the things you want the macro to do and you press `q` to finish. 

You can then replay the macro with `@<letter>` or replay the last macro with
`@@`. 

So, for what did I use these macros? I used them to make my code pretty! 
I like pretty code. I also like to make my own R code pretty as I think it
enhances readability. Coding in R I like making headers like this

```
###############
### SECTION ###
###############
```

But making these by hand is actually quite burdensome. I did this manually for
a while but then it suddenly hit me that this was the perfect thing to write a
little macro for. 

I recorded the following macro (starting at the beginning of the line with a
word that I want to enclose in hashtags). 

```
qai###<Esc>A<Esc><Space>###<Esc>YppkkVR#jjVR#q
```

Okay that seems like a lot of gibberish but let's break it down

```
qa
i###<Esc>
A<Space>###<Esc>
Ypp
kkVr#
jjVr#
q
```

`qa` starts recording the macro and saves the result in register `a`. 

    WORD

`i###<Esc>` Insert (`i`) three hashes `#`.

    ### WORD

`A<Space>###<Esc>` Append (`A`) to the end of the line `<Space>###`. 

    ### WORD ### 

`Ypp` yank (copy) the whole line (`Y`) and paste it twice (`pp`). 

    ### WORD ###
    ### WORD ###
    ### WORD ###

`kkVr#` move up two lines (`kk`), visually select the whole line (`V`) and replace
it with hashes (`r#`).

    ############
    ### WORD ###
    ### WORD ###

`jjVr#` move down two lines (`jj`), visually select the whole line (`V`) and
replace it with hashes (`r#`). 

    ############
    ### WORD ###
    ############

`q` stops recording and stores the macro in the register. 

If I now press `@@` (or `@a`) with the cursor at the beginning of the word the
following happens

``` 
WORD 
```

gets turned into 

```
#############
### WORD ####
#############
```

I thought this was pretty neat!
